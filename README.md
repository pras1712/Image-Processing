Playing with some Pixel Array manipulation.

Color Schemer:
akes a given image and recolors it using colors provided by the user. Each color is treated as an $(r, g, b)$ vector, and each pixel's color is changed to the given color whose difference with the original color is minimal. Also allows user to change color selection, while viewing dynamic changes to the image. Written in Java.
